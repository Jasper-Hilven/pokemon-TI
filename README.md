## Pokemon Obsidian

A game programmed during high school. 

## Installation instructions

1. Transmit everything to the calculator except for this README and the .gif in the movie folder. All the programs should go to the archive memory,except for POK.8xp
2. Open the celtic III app and install Celtic III. Quit celtic III.
3. Ensure that you have enough RAM free to extract POKPIC01.8xg
4. Extract POKPIC01.8xg and archive all the pictures. If some pictures try to overwrite other pictures, let them override.
5. Ensure that you have enough RAM free to extract POKPIC02.8xg
6. Extract POKPIC02.8xg and archive all the pictures
7. Run POK.8xp (should be the only file in RAM)
8. If you receive a "Disabled to save data" warning, set the list with the name pok to RAM and set the first element to 1. 
9. Probably send a mail to jasperhilven@gmail.com if anything doesn't work ;) (I tested it with these files on an emulator succesfully so it can work :) )
